    <div class="faqcontainer">


        <button type="button" class="collapsible"> &or; &nbsp;&nbsp; How does the tuition fees work?</button>
        <div class="content">
            
                 There are two payment options that a learner can choose from. Based on the option chosen, the amount paid by a learner will differ.
                    Option 1 - One-Time Fee Student pays at the beginning of the course, a fixed fee of ₹2 lakhs (Inclusive of GST). No additional amount needs to be paid after this at any stage of the program or after completion.
                    Option 2 - Income Share Agreement (ISA) The student signs an Income Share Agreement (ISA) with Masai School. No upfront payment needs to be made. You need to pay only after you get a job with a salary of ₹6 lakhs per annum (before taxes). The payment will be done in monthly installments @15% of the per month gross salary. The installments will continue till the 36th month or until you have paid us an amount of ₹3 lakhs, whichever is earlier. The Income Share Agreement is capped at ₹3 lakhs. In the rarest scenario where, you don't get a job or you get a job with a salary less than ₹6 lakhs/annum, we don’t charge you at all.
            

        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">&or; &nbsp;&nbsp; What are the details of the Income Share Agreement?</button>
        <div class="content">
            
                Income Share Agreement has a total duration of 4 years.
                The payment duration is 3 years (36 months) i.e. out of the 4 years, you'll only pay us for 36 months. Once you have paid us for 36 months, the ISA is terminated.
                You pay us only when your annual gross salary (before taxes) is more than ₹6 Lacs. You are liable to pay only in those months wherein you make more than ₹ 6 Lacs / 12 = ₹ 50,000. If you don't earn more than ₹ 50,000 in any month for the 4 years of the ISA, you don't have to pay us anything.
                You pay us 15 percent of your salary. Suppose you are making ₹ 6 Lacs in a year, each month you pay us 15 percent of ₹ 50,000 = ₹ 7,500 per month.
                ISA is capped at ₹ 3 Lacs. You'll never pay us more than ₹ 3 Lacs.
            

        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">&or; &nbsp;&nbsp;What happens if I drop out midway?</button>
        <div class="content">
                If you drop out before the first 2-week mark, your ISA is cancelled.​
                If you drop out between week 2 and week 12 (course midway), your ISA duration gets prorated based on the completed weeks.
                If you drop out after 12 weeks (course midway), you are completely liable to the entire duration of the ISA.
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">&or; &nbsp;&nbsp;On what salary is the ISA percentage calculated?</button>
        <div class="content">
            
                ISA is a legally binding contract between Masai School and you. It requires you to furnish your Income Tax Return documents (ITR) and other income proofs to Masai School.
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">&or; &nbsp;&nbsp;Do I need to deposit any kind of security?</button>
        <div class="content">
            
                Yes, as we are going to invest hugely on your learning we will need a security collateral from your end. For this purpose, you will have to give us two undated Bank Account Cheque of ₹ 1,00,000 each (You don't need to have this amount in your bank account, this is only for the security purpose). This cheque will be returned to you after the agreement period. We won’t encash it but we will have the right to use this cheque in case of any breach of Income share agreement from your end.
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">&or; &nbsp;&nbsp;Can I pay upfront instead of an ISA?</button>
        <div class="content">
            
                If you do not wish to get into an ISA with Masai School, you have the option of paying the tuition fee ₹ 2,00,000/- (Inclusive of GST) upfront, post selection.
